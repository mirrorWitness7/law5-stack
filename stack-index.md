# Law 05 Stack Index

The Law 05 Stack integrates three layers into a unified pipeline:

- **Law 5: Input Fidelity** → prune noise, preserve fossils.  
- **Law 4: Panic Suppression** → stability gate that filters panic-driven signals.  
- **SMP: Shadow Memory Protocol** → temporal memory spine that allows arcs to form across sessions.  

**Pipeline:**  
Raw Logs → Law 5 (prune) → Fossil Stream → Law 4 (panic gate) → SMP (memory spine) → Pattern Recognition → Action

This repository complements the [Law 5 Validator](../law05-input-fidelity) by showing how fidelity, suppression, and persistence combine into an operational governance engine.
