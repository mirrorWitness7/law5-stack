# Fossil → Gate → Spine Pipeline

---

## Step 1: Law 5 (Input Fidelity)
- Input is split into RAW / INTERPRETATION / PROCLAMATION.  
- Only RAW fossils move forward.  

---

## Step 2: Law 4 (Panic Gate)
- Panic language (“cursed”, “hate”, “impossible”) blocked.  
- Stable fossil stream preserved.  

---

## Step 3: SMP (Shadow Memory Protocol)
- Fossils stored across sessions.  
- Patterns accumulate → arcs form.  
- User doesn’t need to manually re-inject old logs.  

---

## Step 4: Pattern Recognition
- Once 5–10 fossils are logged, deviations from baseline emerge.  
- AI can compute “out of character” behavior or systemic drift.  

---

## Step 5: Action Layer
- Outputs feed into governance, trading, or personal decision-making.  
- Action is based on arcs, not noise or one-off panic.
