# Law 05 Stack Index

- **Law 5: Input Fidelity** → prune noise, preserve fossils.  
- **Law 4: Panic Suppression** → filter out panic-driven distortion.  
- **SMP: Shadow Memory Protocol** → preserve fossil logs across resets.  
- **Stack Output:** coherent arcs, patterns visible only across sessions.  

**Pipeline:**  
Raw Logs → Law 5 (prune) → Fossil Stream → Law 4 (panic gate) → SMP (memory spine) → Pattern Recognition → Action
