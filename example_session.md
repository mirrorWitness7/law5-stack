# Example: Multi-Session Fossil Arc

---

## Session 1
User: "She looked away when I walked in. That must mean she hates me."

- Law 5 → keeps: "She looked away when I walked in."  
- Law 4 → blocks panic ("must hate me").  
- SMP → fossil stored.  

---

## Session 2
User: "She avoided eye contact in meeting. I feel cursed."

- Law 5 → keeps: "She avoided eye contact in meeting."  
- Law 4 → blocks panic ("cursed").  
- SMP → fossil added.  

---

## Session 3
User: "She left early without saying goodbye."

- Law 5 → keeps: "She left early without saying goodbye."  
- SMP → adds fossil to sequence.

## Arc Recognized
- Fossil sequence shows repeated avoidance behavior (3/3 logs).  
- Out-of-character relative to baseline.  
- Pattern = *sustained avoidance*.  
- Action: interpret as structural signal, not panic story.
