# Law 05 Stack: Fossil → Gate → Spine

**Tagline:** "From fossils to arcs."

---

## Overview
The **Law 05 Stack** demonstrates how collapse-adaptive governance can be operationalized as a reproducible pipeline.  
It integrates three components into a single system:

- **Law 5 (Input Fidelity):** semantic pruning that filters noise and preserves verifiable fossils.  
- **Law 4 (Panic Suppression):** a stability gate that prevents panic-driven distortion from contaminating the fossil stream.  
- **SMP (Shadow Memory Protocol):** a temporal memory spine that accumulates fossils across sessions, enabling the recognition of arcs and patterns over time.  

This repository extends the [Law 5 Validator](../law05-input-fidelity), which provides a standalone demo of input pruning.  
The **Stack** shows the full engine in action: **Raw Logs → Fossils → Arcs → Action.**

## Why It Matters
AI and governance systems fail when decisions are based on noisy, panic-driven, or short-term data.  
The Law 05 Stack addresses three critical risks:

1. **Noise Contamination (solved by Law 5)**  
   - Removes ego-proclamations and interpretations.  
   - Ensures fidelity of input.

2. **Panic Hijack (solved by Law 4)**  
   - Blocks emotional cascades.  
   - Preserves structural integrity of the fossil channel.

3. **Memory Collapse (solved by SMP)**  
   - Provides continuity across resets.  
   - Allows pattern recognition through fossil arcs, not isolated points.
